some micropython things for my inky frame

# main.py
i simplified the provided launcher a little bit. i can't resist a good bit of refactoring, and will be tinkering it to launch my own apps as i make them

# resize.py
a script to be run outside the context of the inky frame. this script resizes files in `img_in` to fit the 7.3" inky frame

# draw_single_image.py
a simple inky app to draw a given image onto the frame
